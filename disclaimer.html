    <p>CypherLock Password Generator and
       CypherLock Password Strength Tester will NOT store, memorize
       or destribute passwords generated by CypherLock Password Generator,
       and or your own passwords that you submit for security testing to our
       CypherLock Password Strength Tester.

  <div class="security-box smaller">
    <p>CypherLock Password Generator produces passwords based on random character
       algorithm and user input criteria.<br />
       The user may determine the length of the character string generated by the
       algorithm which can be used as a user password.<br />
       The user may decide to introduce upper case letters, numbers and symbols
       into pool of possible characters from which the random string of characters
       is generated which can be used as a user password.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="security-box smaller">
    <p>
      CypherLock does not hold or destribute any pre-written sets of characters.
      All resulting sets of characters are a result of randomizing algorithm and user input as described in this
      section.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="security-box smaller">
    <p>The character string generated by CypherLock algorithm may be used as a
        user password only if the user decides to do so and uses the the resulting
        character string as the account password upon registration or during the procedure
        of changing user account password determined by other applications and/or social
        media platforms.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="security-box smaller">
    <p>
      Each resulting string of characters is rare, the probability of repeating the same string twice or more
      is determined by: string length, presence of upper case and lower case letter characters, presence of numbers and special characters.
      The exact number of possible random character strings may vary based upon factors previously presented, however bear in mind
      that no matter how high the number of possible character strings is, it is finite.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="security-box smaller">
    <p>
      Although common practices of cyber security indicate that longer passwords and/or passwords
      with richer variety of different types of characters (upper case letters, numbers and special characters) are
      safer, meaning: more difficult to crack using digital tools and means of breaking into user's accounts, no password is
      100% safe and/or unbreakable. CypherLock cannot guarantee an absolute security of your account if you decide
      to use the character string provided by CypherLock Password Generator as a password to secure your account.

      Security of your personal, private or business information does not depend only on password strength.
      <br />
      Security of your personal, private and business information depends also on security measures implemented and provides
      by the website and/or service which you use. Also you, as a user, are responsible for your own cyber security, safety and integrity of
      your personal, private and business information. We encourage you to do your own research on how you can improve your own online security.
      We also encourage you to always do your own research on security measures and policies integrated and provided by oa online service
      before you decide to use a given online service.

  <div class="security-box smaller">
    <p>
      Different websites, online services and/or social media platforms have their own
      standards and policies regarding passwords, length of passwords and characters that may or may not
      be used as a part of the users' password. Since there are no universally recognized standards
      about passwords to which all websites should adhere to, CypherLock cannot guarantee that the resulting
      string of character may be accepted as a valid password. If the resulting string of characters is
      not in accordance with password policies and standards of a given website, user is encouraged to
      adjust the settings of CypherLock Password Generator in accordance to a given website's password policies and
      standards and attempt to use a new character string as a password.

      The measure of security provided by CypherLock Password Strength Tester is based
      criterias of: password length, character variety, presence of repeating characters, presence of
      upper case and lower case letter characters, presence of numbers and presence of special characters within
      the password that user submits for testing.<br />
      These criterias, although regarded as a password safety criterias in comman cyber security practise, are merely
      indicators and should be regarded as such. CypherLock does not guarantee 100% safety of your personal information
      according to the safety level of the password indicated by the CypherLock Password Strength Tester.
